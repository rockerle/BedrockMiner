Needs a efficiency 5 pickaxe to mine the piston fast enough.
Haste beacon is not necessary!!!!
# Version 2 - Autobuild Update:

Version 2 has a vanilla like keybinding to toggle the miner. When activated just attack/left-click the bedrock block.

<details><summary></summary>While activated you can add or remove blocks that can be mined by the miner, with right clicking the blocks with an item.</details>

The latest released version (v2.2) is currently only for the 1.19 mc versions on the release page. If you need/want this mod for a lower mc version either open an Issue here on Github and ask nicely or backport it yourself. The mc1.19.3 code is available in this repository.

Tips and Tricks:
- Be patient and try again after retoggeling the miner if it didn't work at first try!!!!
- If the miner constantly gives out a "No Pistonplacement found" message you should try to remove the block from a different side (if possible)
- Sticky Pistons are usable, but it won't work if the Block behind the Bedrock can be pulled! [Huhh? What does that mean?](https://imgur.com/a/5WrNWIR)

# old version (mc 1.17.x):
Build the piston/redstone torch setup and press 'b' for activating bedrock removal.
You need to look away from the bedrock block you want to remove.
